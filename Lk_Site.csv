The site contains a number of archaeological deposits scattered for a distance of 1,800 feet along the river bank . Three areas of the site, A, B, and C, were excavated by Washington State University summer field crews directed in 1967 by Roderick Sprague and in 1968 by Frank Leonhardy.

The points from the latter excavation were used in a chronological chart of point types of the Lower Fraser and Gulf Islands (Carlson 1983, Fig. 1:7). At 5420 ± 230 BP this site has the earliest beginning date of all the sites in the study area and the largest number of points. The Mayne phase deposits, that contain most of the points and thousands of pieces of cores and other debitage, are associated with the burial area of the site at this period, and it is probable that the makers of these points were buried there. It is also probable that these individuals were specialists in the manufacture of flaked stone artifacts and that this site served as a distribution point from which these
artifacts were traded to the surrounding region. The site has components of all four cultural phases found this locality-Mayne, Locarno Beach, Marpole, and San Juan - although the Locarno Beach phase barely represented in the 1968 SFU excavations that produced the vast majority of the chipped stone points from the site (Carlson 1970).The stratification (Figure 18) at the SFU excavated part of the site is complex and consists of a lowermost black matrix lacking shell dating between 5420 and 3690 BP containing Mayne phase cultural material including five burials, succeeded by a Marpole phase deposit with varying amounts of shell, followed by a shallow San Juan phase deposit with abundant shell. One hundred and ninety-six projectile points came from this excavation. Whereas the lower half of the deposit, 90 to 150 cm below the surface, was relatively intact, the upper portion contained mixed assemblages of both older and younger materials caused by the excavation of pits and depressions in the older deposits by the aboriginal inhabitants. The battleship diagram (Figure 19) showing the relative frequency of point types by depth without reference to stratification illustrates this mixing; the early types (Ia, Ib, II, III) continued to be found in upper levels although in diminished frequencies relative to the more recent types (Ic, IV, VI).",,"lightgrey","o",20.00000

Archaeological excavations were conducted in the rockshelter by Washington State University summer field crews under the direction of Richard D. Daugherty between 1962 and 1965. Excavations were continued in the rockshelter and initiated on the floodplain in 1968 as the result of new discoveries at the site (Fryxell and others l968a). The site was inundated by the Lower Monumental Dam reservoir in 1969 despite efforts of the U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, to save it with a protective levee.
